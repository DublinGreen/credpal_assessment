Using Larvel/Vue create a simple application that allows a user do the following:

 

1.    Create an account using a referral system, kindly auto generate referral codes during account creation.

2.    Earn 1,000 upon account creation if the referral code is used.

3.    View wallet balances.

4.    Simulate instant and future account transfers.

5.    Simulate KYC levels for transfer limits. A user with a valid ID should be able to transfer over 50,000 AND one without a valid ID shouldn't.

This would ideally be thoroughly documented with complete test coverage, kindly host the code submission on bitbucket/github and provide a clear setup instruction within the README.md file.

 

The deadline for submission is Friday 30th October 2020, on or before 12:00pm.
